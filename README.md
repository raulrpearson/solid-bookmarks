# Solid Bookmarks

> A browser extension to save your bookmarks into a [Solid
> pod](https://solid.inrupt.com/how-it-works).

This is an early pre-pre-alpha-nightly.

The best way to try this extension out is to copy or clone the repo to some
folder, `cd` into it and run `web-ext run --verbose`. This will launch a Firefox
instance with the extension installed. Navigate to some page, and click on the
"Bookmark to Solid" page action button.

To install [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext#installation-from-npm)
globally, run `npm i -g web-ext`.
